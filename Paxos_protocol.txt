-- Used for implementing a fault-tolerant distributed system.
-- It is a consensus algorithm.
-- The consensus problem as follows:
	Given a set of processes we need to choose a value by consensus. Some of the coditions for the same:
	-- The value to be choosen needs to be among the proposed set of values.
	-- Only one value should be chosen.
	-- All process should be informed about the chosen value.
	-- If no value is proposed then no value should be chosen.
	-- Until a value is chosen the processes should not be informed about a choice.
-- So the consensus problem requires that eventually some value should be chosen and all the processes need to be informed about the same.
-- Here each process can choose to play one or more following roles: proposers, acceptors and learners. 
-- The algorithm requires one proposed value to agreed upon by majority of acceptors, and to allow modification of the accepted value 
	if aother process proposes a new value.
	So, the algorithm allows to coerce an acceptor to change its vote, if it is shown that a new proposed value may be accepted.
-- So a proposer starts by sending a message "prepare(n)" where n is the proposed value, to all (or majority) of acceptors. 
	Each acceptor compares n to the highest-numbered proposal for which it has responded (an earlier reply to some "prepare(n')").
	If n>n', then the acceptor sends an acknowledgement -- ack(n,v,n'), where is the "highest-numbered value" accepted earlier by the 
	acceptor, n' is the number of the proposal containing v. 
	If n<N' then the acceptor sends a NACK (or may not reply).
-- The proposer then waits for reply from majority of acceptors, and then chooses the most recent value of "v". 
	The most recent value is determined from the numbering of all the received n' (from various acceptors). 
	The proposer now performs second (actual) round of sending a message, and send a message "accept(n,v) to the majority of acceptors.
-- The acceptors may choose "v" unless they receive another n" with n" > n (proposal number ordering). 
	If majority of acceptors, select "v" then it becomes the decision value for the protocol.
-- Finally, the acceptors may inform the proposer (and all the learners) about the chosen value.
